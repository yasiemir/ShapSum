More than a dozen bombs exploded in Bombay last night killing about 200 people and   injuring more than a thousand in India's commercial heart.
Despite a bomb attack last Friday,  the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) reopened   Monday with the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent by Tuesday.
The attack came just   four days after a systematic bomb attack on India's commercial heart in Bombay,   raising fears of a resumption of last December's intercommunal violence.
India suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion in the crowded trade   and residential district of Bowbazaar in Calcutta destroyed two blocks of flats killing at   least 45 people and injuring scores more.
Unlike the riots that racked the city last December, Friday's attack was   clearly high-technology terrorism carried out with Semtex plastic explosives, high-grade   timers, efficient organization and money.
Last night's targets included the Bombay Stock Exchange and the landmark Air India   building.
The exchange denies the allegations, but the dispute does nothing to   stimulate the stock market where shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early   last year.
