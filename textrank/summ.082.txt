On Sunday an anti-American newspaper in Iran blamed the United States for the death   of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake, since it plundered Iran's oil   and other resources for 25 years preventing application of the national wealth to   development of "advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems."
Estimated casualties have now reached 50,000 killed and   200,000 injured.
Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran, claims that the Islamic   Republic of Iran is purposely underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's   massive earthquake (7.3-7.7 on the Richter scale) out of a fear of  political backlash.
The earthquake that hit Iran early Thursday exacted particularly large casualties   because people were asleep in fragile homes built on a flood plain of  loosely deposited   soil that shifts in an earthquake.
Thousands were buried in the rubble of their   homes.
After years of animosity, the U.S. government has come to the aid of Iran, channeling   $300,000 in earthquake relief supplies through the American Red Cross.
Planes loaded with earthquake relief supplies are arriving in Iran from around the world,   including one from the United States, the first such American benevolence toward Iran   since the hostage crisis of 1979-80.
