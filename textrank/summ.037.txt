A United States Coast Guard ship on patrol spotted a man and woman in a raft about 30   miles off the coast of Costa Rica.
Little attention is paid when a vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant   ocean, but the loss of a relatively modern passenger ferry in European waters concerns   the public.
The vessel   was found near Chios, a Greek island in the eastern Aegean Sea, where a Greek naval   vessel sank a Turkish warship on 7 June 1882.
Instead, the Korean crew sank their ship,   and transferred to another Korean ship sailing nearby.
The ship was 600 miles south of Cape Horn, and about two miles from a United   States research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula.
Over the past two decades the United   Nations Maritime Organization has devoted much thought to ship safety, but now in   September 1994 it is an imperative.
A freighter with a cargo of beer sank today 28 nautical miles north of the Ameland, a   Dutch island in the North Sea.
The ship was carrying jet fuel, gasoline, canisters of compressed gases, and other supplies   to the Argentine Esperanza Station near the tip of the Antarctica Peninsula.
