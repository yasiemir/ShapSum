An Iraq-Kuwait crisis erupted July 17 when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accused   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing his country $14 billion in lost revenue   because of their overproduction of OPEC oil limits.
As punishment for not withdrawing its forces from Kuwait, the U.N. Security Council   voted to impose trade and military sanctions against Iraq, including a ban on oil   purchases.
Iraq's U.N. representative said they would withdraw when the "free   Kuwaiti interim government' of "revolutionary youth" who toppled the Kuwaiti   government, and to whose aid they came, requested it.
Iraq's U.N. representative said the U.N.   should not be involved, the fall of Kuwait was an internal matter.
The U.N. Security Council demanded that Iraq unconditionally withdraw its invasion   forces from Kuwait.
Earlier, the Iraqi-  installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations to not take punishing   measures against it or Iraq, ominously saying that such countries "have to remember they   have interests and citizens in Kuwait."
They feel this might provoke Saddam Hussein into occupying   Saudi oil fields 150 miles south of Kuwait, thus giving him control of more oil than any   country in the world.
