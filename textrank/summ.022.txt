Hurricane Andrew, which killed 15 people and left a quarter of a million people  homeless in south Florida, hit sparsely populated farming communities and swampland  in Louisiana killing two people and injuring less than 100.
Last night U.S. cities along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on  storm watch for Hurricane Andrew which early yesterday caused at least eight deaths  and heavy property damage in southern Florida.
General Accident (GA), the leading British insurer, estimated yesterday that its losses  from Hurricane Andrew might reach $40 million; however, GA has only a half-percent  share of the Florida market and the estimate is based on the assumption that GA's catastrophe insurance would be triggered by the extensive claims.
Other insurers have  estimated that losses from the storm that hit Florida and Louisiana might be anywhere  from $1 billion to $20 billion.
Hurricane Andrew hit southern Florida Monday morning, was moving north-west across  the Gulf of Mexico yesterday, and now threatens New Orleans and the coast from  Mississippi to Texas.
Most of the  insurance claims from damage in Florida and Louisiana will be filed with State Farm,  Allstate, and American International Group insurance companies.
