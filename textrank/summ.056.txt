The annual Booker ballyhoo got going yesterday when the judges for this year's #20,000 prize   for British (and Commonwealth) fiction announced the shortlist.
The shortlist of six for the #20,000 Booker Prize for fiction prompted the publishing industry to   comment that some on the list "are B-team writers at best" and that others "don't make the   grade".
Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his   novel, "The Remains of the Day", a love story about a butler's English vacation.
After hours of deliberation last night, the #20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, as it always has in its   26-year history, provoked controversy when it went to James Kelman for "How Late It Was,   How Late", the story of a Scottish lowlife narrated in Glaswegian dialect.
Critic and novelist Antonia Byatt won the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award   for "Possession", one of the year's six finalists in the 21-year old competition.
America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards but in terms of   excitement, hoopla, and man-on-the-street interests, there's nothing akin to the #15,000   ($26,000) Booker Prize.
