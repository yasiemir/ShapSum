Relatives of the 47 victims killed in the No.2 gun explosion aboard the Iowa last   Wednesday were among the 6000 people who attended a memorial at Norfolk Naval Air   Station on Monday.
The Navy has imposed a moratorium on firing the 16-inch guns on the Iowa and its three   sister battleships, as investigators begin searching for the cause of the explosion on the   Iowa that claimed 47.
At least 47 crewmen died today in an explosion in one of three giant WWII-era gun   turrets on the battleship Iowa.
Eleven people inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the   ship's magazines, survived, the Navy said.
The USS Iowa steamed home from Puerto Rico on Friday with investigators on board   interviewing crewmen and reviewing a videotape of the explosion taken by an Iowa   officer who was recording the firing of the big guns.
Retired Adm. Eugene LaRocque of the Center for Defense Information said Thursday   that the 16-inch guns on the Iowa, which can fire a 2,700 pound shell a distance of 20   miles are "old-fashioned and inherently dangerous."
