Indian border guards fired on hundreds of Pakistanis who tried to cross a  cease-fire line separating the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir from that  held by India.
Kashmir militants had earlier campaigned to join Pakistan  because of its predominately Moslem population but now they wish  independence and status as a neutral country.
The kidnap victims were the Vice Chancellor  of Kashmir University and the general manager of Hindustan Machine Tools Co.  A spokesman for the Students Liberation Front, a branch of the Jammu-Kashmir  Liberation Front said those two and another hostage would be killed within  24 hours unless three jailed militants were released.
Moslem militants killed five more people in their fight for independence  from predominantly Hindu India bringing the total killed since January 20th  to at least 195.
Relations were strained between India and Pakistan after Indian  troops launched a crackdown on Moslem separatists in Jammu-Kashmir.
Moslem militants kidnapped two prominent Kashmir residents and threatened to  kill them in retaliation for the killing of six militants crossing into  Pakistan for arms and training.
Police had imposed a 24-hour curfew to quell the violence resulting from the  militants, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, holding anti-India  demonstrations.
