Bob Hope will pay tribute to Lucille Ball on Saturday with a special "Bob Hope's Love   Affair With Lucille Ball."
Lucille Ball was not the scatterbrained Lucy, but a smart   perfectionist, who knew the world was better off laughing.
She   and her first husband, Desi Arnaz, produced and co-starred on the precedence setting "I   Love Lucy", one of the most popular TV shows ever.
Lucille Ball, the pioneering queen of television comedy, died Wednesday at 77 of a   ruptured abdominal artery.
Gail Gordon, Lucille Ball's sidekick through radio and television, said "the world will   miss her greatly."
President Bush praised her "gift of love" as well as laughter, and   former President and Mrs. Reagan called her an "American institution."
After her divorce from Arnaz, Miss Ball married Gary   Morton and starred in other shows.
Tributes began flowing in   immediately including ones from former President and Nancy Reagan, Dick Van Dyke,   and the chairman of CBS Inc.  Miss Ball created a legacy, both as a comedian and a TV   entrepreneur, that has not been matched.
