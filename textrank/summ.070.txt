State Farm Insurance Co., spokesman Jerry Parson, said the company expects   Hurricane Hugo claims as high as $400 million in South Carolina, where it insures   20% of the homes.
National Hurricane Center forecasters used computer models to track Hugo's path   into Charleston, giving people time to evacuate the South Carolina coast.
Mayor Joseph   Riley Jr., other city officials and several reporters stayed in Charleston's historic   City Hall Thursday night as the area's worst hurricane in three decades roared   through.
Late Thursday there was hope that Hugo might miss Charleston, but the storm   gathered strength as it slammed into the city packing 135 mph winds.
Kingston Historian Edwin Ford remembered the letter when   Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolinas last week, and on Wednesday a local Red   Cross chapter began collecting donations.
The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed   17 lives in South Carolina, only two of which were in the Charleston area where   Hugo's 135 mph winds were most prevalent.
Nationwide Insurance Co., the biggest home and auto insurer in North Carolina and   the third largest insurer in South Carolina, expects storm claims near $100 million.
