Earlier, Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its Kuwaiti   border after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the OPEC cartel   had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's revenue, and that Kuwait had been   stealing oil from a field that straddles the border.
Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of driving down oil prices by overproduction thereby   costing Iraq billions in lost revenues, of stealing Iraqi oil from a common field along their   border, and of conspiring with the U.S. and Israel to weaken Iraq.
Today, Iraq struck back by rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait as the   U.N. Security Council overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions   to punish it for invading Kuwait.
President Bush embargoed all U.S. trade with Iraq and froze that nation's assets while   refusing to rule out the use of force to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders.
Meanwhile, Kuwait's leadership is safe in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait's U.S. ambassador   has appealed for American military intervention.
Kuwait suggested that   Iraq's belligerence was to force Kuwait to forgive billions of Iraqi war debt.
