Patrick Edward Purdy, aka Eddie Purdy West, who killed five children at a Stockton,   California, school on Tuesday had a history of problems with the law.
Teachers   and students of the South Carolina school understand the emotional upset of the   California students because on September 16 a man with a history of mental problems   entered Oakland Elementary School, killing two girls and wounding nine other people.
When the shooting   was over, five children of Vietnamese and Cambodian descent were killed and the   gunman, Patrick Edward Purdy, lay dead from a self-inflicted gun shot wound, the rifle   and the pistol, with victory written on it, lay on the ground beside him.
Several months ago he purchased an AK-47 and then returned to his home   town of Stockton where he killed five children and wounded 39 other children as well as   a children at Cleveland Elementary School before taking his own life.
A heavily armed gunman invaded Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton and killed   five children and wounded 30 other people before taking his own life.
In an attempt to reach out to the California school where five children were killed by a   gunman, a South Carolina school will send cards and words of encouragement.
