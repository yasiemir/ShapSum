Danish studies of the drug Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, show that the drug   reduces the chance of a new heart attack in patients recovering from a heart attack.
When used with   a clot-dissolving drug, given within 24 hours of a heart attack, the chance of a second   heart attack is reduced from 13 percent to 8 percent.
A study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that an   intestinal operation to lower cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced the risk of a   second heart attack.
TGF beta is   normally present in heart cells but is missing from rat heart cells damaged by the   simulated heart attack.
The first phase of the study showed that giving tissue plasminogen activator,   or TPA,  a clot-dissolving drug, right after a heart attack dramatically improved chances   of survival.
Lowering cholesterol levels and educating people   to get to the hospital  within three to four hours of the first sign of a heart attack would   significantly increase survival rates.
Despite this decrease, it is believed   that up to 50 percent of the heart disease cased by the clogging of blood vessels feeding   the heart; the most lethal heart ailment.
