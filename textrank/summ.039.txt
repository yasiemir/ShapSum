Following his takeover of the unprofitable New York Daily News, British publisher Robert   Maxwell plans to raise about #250 million ($448 million) through the sale of shares in his Mirror   Group Newspaper Ltd. of Britain.
Michael Stoney, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, and Kevin and Ian   Maxwell, the sons of the late Robert Maxwell, are named as the three top persons involved in at   least 28 "unusual" payments from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) bank accounts.
Trustees filed two writs last week in Manhattan for Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Scheme   and Maxwell Communications Corporation Works Pension Scheme.
The newspaper was not identified but there is speculation that it might be The New York Daily   News, which is struggling to restore profitability; USA Today, which would mesh with   Maxwell's efforts for the new paper The European; or the Chicago Sun-Times that has been   sliding in circulation since 1985.
The writs allege that   Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting currency from the two   Robert Maxwell-controlled pension schemes to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interest   would be repaid.
