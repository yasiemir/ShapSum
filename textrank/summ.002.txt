On Sunday an anti-American newspaper in Iran blamed the United States for  tens of   thousands of deaths in last week's earthquake, claiming that because of the U.S.'s   plundering of Iran's oil and other resources for 25 years, Iran's national wealth was not   applied to development of  "advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems."
Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran, claims that the Islamic   Republic of Iran is purposely underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's   massive earthquake (7.3-7.7 on the Richter scale) out of a fear of political backlash.
The earthquake that hit Iran early Thursday exacted particularly large casualties   because people were asleep in fragile homes built on a flood plain of loosely deposited   soil that shifts in an earthquake.
Countries around the world, both friendly and hostile to Irans' Islamic government, sent   help to Iran where 40,000 people died in the earthquake Thursday.
Donations for Iranian earthquake   relief may also be sent to the Red Cross, UNICEF, Bank Meli Iran, and the Adventist   Development and Relief Agency.
The earthquake which   hit northern Iran Thursday with a magnitude of 7.3-7.7  killed at least 35,000 and left   400,000 homeless.
