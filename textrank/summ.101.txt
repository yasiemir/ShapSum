East Germany's ousted secret police chief, Erich Mielke, threatened to break former   Communist leader Erich Honecker's neck when the two faced each other in jail.
Former East German leader Erich Honecker and Erich Mielke, former head of the secret   police, were interrogated by federal prosecutors about their role in killings of people who   tried to flee the country.
As protests gathered strength in the fall of 1989, East Germany's longtime orthodox   leader, Erich Honecker "lost touch with reality" according to the man who succeeded him   as Communist leader only to be ousted later.
Michail Gorbachev urged all sides to take their time in deciding the fate of Erich   Honecker as former East German leader spent a seventh day of refuge inside the Chilean   Embassy in Moscow.
Earlier this month, East German prosecutors said Honecker   and former state security chief Erich Mielke would be charged with treason and   corruption for misuse of their positions and state funds.
Ousted East German leader, Erich Honecker will not stand trial in East Germany as long   as the formerly communist country exists.
Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was arrested and taken to prison today and a   prosecutor said he will be tried for high treason in March.
