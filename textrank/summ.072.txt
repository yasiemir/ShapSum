The battle for Tiananmen Square was fought primarily  in the streets leading to the   square where scores of people fell trying to prevent troops and armored military   vehicles from moving on the students camped in the square.
It is apparent that martial law and the assault on Tiananmen Square   last Sunday has not put an end to the pro-democracy movement in China which began   on April 18 after the death of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.
Shooting continued through the night until 5 a.m. Sunday morning when the   demonstrators,  surrounded by armed and firing troops, began leaving the square,   ending their three-week occupation.
Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square early Sunday, shooting and beating their   way through crowds of pro-democracy protesters.
Today's killings and flight of hundreds of thousands of protesters from Tiananmen   Square is the outcome of events beginning with the death of former Communist party   chief Hu Yaobang on April 15 this year.
Yesterday the U.S. suspended all military sales and visits of Chinese military   leaders in response to the violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement in   China which began on April 18 after the death of former Communist Party chief Hu   Yaobang.
