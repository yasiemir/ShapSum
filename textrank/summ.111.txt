They expressed their   hope that under the leadership of the Guangdong provincial party committee and   government, people would make concerted efforts to help flood victims solve their living   problems, and go all out to battle the floods to ensure the safety of the Bei Jiang dike,   Guangzhou city and the Zhu Jiang Delta.
According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, after the largest   or the second largest flood peaks since the liberation of China occurred a few days ago in   the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, and Gan Jiang rivers, water levels in these rivers are   dropping slowly.
A team led by Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee Political   Bureau and member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, arrived in Jiangxi to   provide on-the-spot guidance for the on-going flood fighting and relief work and to direct   the resumption of industrial and agricultural production.
Governor Chen Bangzhu said in an interview that   this flood in Hunan province is of a severity unseen for the past 100 years in terms of   both water level and quantity.
