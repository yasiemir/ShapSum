Although insurers will pay out billions of dollars for damage from this week's California  earthquake, investors predict that the psychological impact of the catastrophe will  produce higher insurance rates and a long-term gain for insurance companies.
In the wake of Tuesday's earthquake many San Francisco-area homeowners will pay  for damage out-of-pocket while insurance companies may actually benefit from the  quake.
The insurance companies, after three years of declining rates, are likely to win  rate hikes from state regulators to compensate for the combined losses from the  earthquake and Hurricane Hugo which hit the southeastern United States earlier this  month.
Yesterday, in response to the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew  into a whirlwind of activity that seemed designed to dispel any thought that the White  House was not engaged.
Vulnerable because of his past opposition to a gasoline tax increase that  would augment transportation funding, the Governor seems more interested in diverting  blame than in learning everything possible from Tuesday's disaster.
But it is likely that as insurers increase the amount of  reinsurance they buy, reinsurance prices will rise followed by an increase in basic  insurance rates.
