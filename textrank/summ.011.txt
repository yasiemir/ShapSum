Customers in Wal-Mart here in Fort Walton Beach were surprised to find Sam Walton,   founder of the discount chain, helping cashiers when an electrical glitch shut down the   cash registers.
A book entitled, "Wal-Mart: Sam Walton's Retail Phenomenon" was published two years   after Walton died.
The Wal-Mart Stores, Inc, will open a Visitors Center on Wednesday here in Bentonville   on the downtown square where Sam Walton opened for business on 9 May 1950.
Sam Walton's phenomenal success as a retailer stemmed from his personality, and his   willingness to defy accepted retailing wisdom.
The 1989 publication of the Forbes listing of the richest people again has Sam Walton as   the nation's richest man.
It does not directly address his company's non-union policies,   and the impact of his 40 billion dollar giant on the mom-and-pop stores in the small   towns where he located his stores.
After a three year stint in the army Walton opened a Ben Franklin franchise, and   eventually became the largest franchisee.
Displays include a replica of Walton's   original office, and a hula skirt that he wore for his "dance on Wall Street" after the   company surpassed the profit goal for 1984.
