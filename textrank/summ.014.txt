A biography of former Beatle John Lennon by Albert Goldman, discloses a sometime   unflattering portrait of both Lennon and his second wife Yoko Ono.
Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono were returning to their apartment in New   York on December 8, 1980 when Lennon was shot to death by Mark Chapman a   deranged fan.
A biography that portrays former Beatle John Lennon as a drug addled, anorexic,   bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York is totally fiction said his   widow, Yoko Ono.
Both his first wife,   Cynthia Lennon and his second wife Yoko Ono as well as his two sons have denounced   the book as exploiting Lennon's memory and full of lies and untruths.
Though it failed to   delve too deeply into the darker side of Lennon and the Beatles it does capture the music   and the times in which Lennon lived.
Lennon's widow   collaborated in the film and described it as the definitive documentary of John Lennon's   life.
Proceeds of the concert   will go to the Spirit Foundation, the charity founded by John Lennon and his wife Ono in   1978.
