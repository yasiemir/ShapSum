In an   effort to stave off the worst effects of the drought, farmers in Oregon shipped 20 tons of   hay to Kentucky and other states were compiling information on where hay might be   available.
The outlook for the next 30 days to three months indicates that the areas   worst hit by the drought can expect little relief with chances of a less than normal amount   of rainfall  ranging from 55 percent in the major grain growing states to 70 percent in part   of southern California.
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, speaking at a meeting of farm magazine, extension,   advertising, co-op, and broadcasting editors, said that although the United States is   suffering from a severe drought, the U.S. will continue to be a major player in world   agriculture.
The current drought may be cause for the government to ease crop acreage restrictions   next year in an effort to rebuild the grain industry.
Elsewhere, severe summer storms which have spawned tornados in Kansas   and caused high winds in Indiana and Michigan, causing widespread damage did little to   alleviate drought conditions in those states.
