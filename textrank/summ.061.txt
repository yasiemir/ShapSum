Now, in May 1988, the Moscow   News has published an article that makes a clear attempt to refute some of the charges   made by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media against Sakharov and his wife.
The latest issue of the Soviet News included a sensitive article on Andrei Sakharov and   his wife, Yelena Bonner.
Andrei Sakharov's visit to the United States has gone virtually unreported in Moscow,   with only a radio broadcast saying he had voiced opposition to the "Star Wars" program.
Soviet physicists, in a rebuff to the Soviet Union's scientific establishment, voted on   Friday to nominate Andrei Sakharov to be a candidate in the March parliamentary   elections.
Sakharov has supported Gorbachev's reforms, but has pressed Gorbachev for speedier   progress in improving the Soviet record on human rights.
Colleagues in the Soviet Congress   observed a minute of silence in honor of the man who was considered a national hero for   his work on the hydrogen bomb, and later reviled for his stand on human rights.
Radio Moscow said Sakharov made the statement in a Boston news conference.
Andrei Sakharov, the 68 year-old scientist and human rights activist, died Thursday of an   apparent heart attack in his Moscow apartment.
