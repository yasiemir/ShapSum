A ceremony held on Friday and attended by Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze as well as their colleagues from France, Britain,   and the two Germanys marked the removal of Checkpoint Charlie, the allied checkpoint   20 yards from the crossing into East Berlin.
Checkpoint Charlie was erected after   Communist East Germany built the Berlin Wall and it came to symbolize the Cold War.
Attended by a brass band and the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies,   Checkpoint Charlie was lifted into history today.
Checkpoint   Charlie became superfluous last Fall when East Germany overthrew its communist   government and the German borders were opened.
As the U.S. Army band played a song about old Berlin, a crane hoisted the rectangular   white sentry station known as Checkpoint Charlie onto a waiting truck.
The proposal also called for the   departure of Western troops from West Berlin within six months as well as a 50 percent   reduction of the troops of all fours nations in the country within five years, eventually   reducing them further to a level of token contingents or completely withdrawing from   Germany.
