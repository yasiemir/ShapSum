As Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph wind roared outside, Charleston S.C.'s mayor Joseph P.   Riley, city officials and a few reporters stayed in Charleston's City Hall watching the   storm's fury.
The storm with winds reaching 135   mph hit Charleston head-on Thursday night, the first major hurricane to strike   Charleston since Hurricane Gracie made landfall 70 miles to the south in 1959.
The leading edge of Hugo with winds up to   125 mph from 105 mph yesterday, is likely to hit between Savannah, Ga. And   Charleston, S.C. any time after 8 p.m. A hurricane warning was in effect between   Fernandina Beach Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C. Hurricane Hugo has put to test the city of Charleston, S.C. which has survived   earthquake, battle and storm in its 300-year history.
Pinpointing the exact location of Hurricane Hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters   analyzed computer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the   current path of the hurricane to make an educated guess which turned out to be right.
State Farm expects its total claims   for Hugo to reach $500 million which is more than three times the record $165 million   for Hurricane Alicia in 1983.
