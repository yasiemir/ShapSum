Andrei D. Sakharov, 68-year-old physicist, human rights activist, and winner of the 1975   Nobel Peace Prize, died Thursday of an apparent heart attack in his Moscow apartment.
45,000 grievers filed past the body of Andrei D. Sakharov -- physicist, Nobel Peace Prize   winner, human rights advocate, legislator, and his country's conscience.
Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov was elected in April to the new Soviet   Congress of People's Deputies, two years after being released from seven years of   internal exile.
Soviet physicists at Moscow's prestigious Lebedev Institute voted 1543 to 22 in secret   ballot Friday to nominate 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov to   parliament, two days after the Academy of Sciences rejected him and other reformers as   candidates.
Sakharov helped form the   1970s Soviet dissident movement, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, and was exiled   internally for seven years after criticizing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
Less than two years ago, the 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner was freed by   Gorbachev from internal exile in Gorky, where he was banished in 1980 for opposing   Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
