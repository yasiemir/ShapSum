The mayors of Charleston and North Charleston, S.C. gave credit to residents of   their cities for the low fatality rate from Hurricane Hugo which hit the city   with full force.
After devastating Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto   Rico on Sunday and Monday with winds up to 150 mph, killing at least 20 people   and leaving perhaps 100,000 homeless, Hurricane Hugo slowed down yesterday to   winds of 105-125 mph, only to pick up speed again and crash into Charleston,   S.C. at midnight with winds of 135 mph.
Supercomputers and satellites helped predict the path and landfall of Hurricane   Hugo in time to allow evacuation of Charleston, S.C., but hurricane tracking is   not an exact science.
Today the hurricane moved inland with steadily diminishing winds and   was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 A.M. Two insurance companies said Tuesday that they anticipate $600 million in claims   from Hurricane Hugo which may become the most expensive ever for the industry.
The National Hurricane Center provided life-saving information as Hurricane Hugo   moved across the Caribbean toward the Carolinas.
