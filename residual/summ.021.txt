The Dog Fanciers Club organized a lunch at Sardi's on Wednesday for two of their   champions, the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog.
Bill McFadden, a 32-year-old professional dog handler, knows that the secret to   producing champions is just plain, hard work.
He was named best in show at the prestigious   Westminister Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden last month.
The "intefadeh", the word used to describe the 9-month-old wave of Palestinian   violence in Israel, may have drastically reduced this year's foreign competition as   compared with a similar show last year.
McFadden's latest product, a Kerry blue terrier named   Kerrageen's Hotspur with 37 Best in Show wins, is the top in his breed of all time.
Marco, a feisty boxer, walked off with the champion's trophy at Israel's dog-of-the-year   contest held in Tel Aviv's Exhibition Center.
More than 2,500 dogs, representing 118 breeds, will compete at Sunday's All Breed Dog   Show and Obedience Trials at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
Other attractions include   an expert who will answer behavioral questions about pets, free veterinary advice, a   demonstration of how 4-H youngsters train puppies to become guide dogs and more than   70 vendors selling dog paraphernalia.
