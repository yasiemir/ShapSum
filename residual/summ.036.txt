Still, the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, killing more than 6000   people, was a hurricane that hit Galveston, Texas on Sept. 8, 1900.
The hurricane   hit the Yucatan after battering other Caribbean countries, particularly the Dominican   Republic and Jamaica, where it has been called the worst natural disaster in history.
Hurricane Gilbert, a Category 5 storm with winds of 175 mph and the lowest barometric   pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere, may be the most intense hurricane   ever recorded.
Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100 mph winds, and officials   issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and   Cuba.
Hurricane Gilbert, a category 5, one of the strongest storms in history battered the   Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
The other two are Hurricane Camille in 1969 that bulldozed the Mississippi coast   with a 28 foot wave, leaving 1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead, and the Labor Day   storm of 1935.
