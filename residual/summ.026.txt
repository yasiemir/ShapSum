Clark AFB, Philippines, was evacuated today after gases, ash and rock spewed from   Mount Pinatubo located 10 miles from the U.S. base.
Five explosions rocked Mount Pinatubo today between 08:40 a.m. and 11:05 p.m.   causing residents of nearby Angeles and the remaining personnel on Clark AFB to flee   the area.
President Aquino dismissed a British newspaper report that the U.S. had warned of   possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages nuclear storage sites at Clark   AFB which was abandoned Monday by nearly 15,000 Americans.
Since Pinatubo began erupting last week,   Philippine officials have evacuated more than 12,000 people in three provinces.
Mount Pinatubo erupted late Wednesday and early today forcing another evacuation of   Clark AFB.
Thus far, at least four people have died, 24 have been injured, and about 84,000   evacuated since Pinatubo began erupting Sunday after six centuries of dormancy.
Mount Pinatubo exploded today, hurling ash and gas over 12 miles high.
A cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above Mount Pinatubo today.
U.S. officials will not comment on whether nuclear weapons are   stored at Clark, but they deny the suggestion that molten rock falling on base weapons   depots would create a radiation danger.
