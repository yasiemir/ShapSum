A strong earthquake hit Nepal and parts of eastern India on Sunday, triggering landslides   and collapsing buildings.
Nepal's   Department of Geology said the earthquake measured 5.7 on the Richter scale.
First reports said 100 people may have died.
The   quake, lasting about 40 seconds, was centered near Udayapur, a town near the Indian-  Nepalese border and 100 miles southeast of Katmandu, Nepal's capital.
In Nepal, police bulldozed teetering houses Tuesday to keep people from returning to   homes left unsafe by a devastating earthquake.
The quake was   also felt in the Indian capital of New Delhi and Calcutta, but there were no reports of   casualties.
The deadliest earthquake to strike the region since 1950 triggered landslides and   destroyed houses in the mountainous India-Nepal border area early Sunday, killing at   least 237 people and injuring more than 1500.
In Nepal's cities of Katmandu and   Biratnagar, and in Patna, India, rumors of expected new quakes sent thousands of people   into the streets.
The U.S. Geological Survey office in   Golden, Colorado recorded the quake at a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 on the Richter   scale, with its epicenter 100 miles southeast of Katmandu.
