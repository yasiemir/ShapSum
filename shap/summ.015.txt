Checkpoint Charlie,  constructed after the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, was a symbol of the Cold War.
Today in a moving ceremony  Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall border post, was  hoisted by crane onto a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum.
Today at an elaborate ceremony that brought together top diplomats of the two  Germanys and the four World War II allies, a crane removed Checkpoint Charlie,  symbol of a divided world.
Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who as mayor of West  Berlin had challenged erection of the wall in the early 1960's, was also in attendance.
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze praised the end of a legacy of confrontation which had required the  checkpoint.
Shevardnadze also  remarked at a ceremony for the removal of Checkpoint Charlie that all western troops  should be removed from "greater Berlin" within six months after unification, a provision  which apparently would also apply to Soviet troops just outside the city proper.
Large sections of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily.
On Friday a crane lifted Checkpoint Charlie, the Allied border crossing on the west side  of the Berlin Wall, and placed it on a flatbed truck.
