Any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with TGF beta is at least a   year away.
The TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as   tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack.
Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol drugs, doubts   remained about whether lower cholesterol actually helped people to live longer.
A large study has shown that taking a single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack   risk in half.
A natural substance called transforming growth factor (TGF) beta appears to be able to   limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.
A study at the Jefferson Medical   College in Philadelphia showed that laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks,   suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of TGF beta than rats that did not   receive TGF beta.
If 15% of heart attack patients were   discharges after three days, the annual savings would be $280 million.
New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks, may help victims leave the hospital   as early as three days after their attacks.
