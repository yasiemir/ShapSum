More than 18,000 runners are expected to run in the 1987 Los Angeles Marathon.
The city has given the promoters an eight-year operating contract.
Makers of cars, cameras, soft drinks, banks, and   even a hospital have signed on as sponsors in Los Angeles.
Other   marathons have had corporate backing, but Los Angeles is out in front in making a   marathon into a commercial spectacle.
Unlike most   marathons, Los Angeles does not pay appearance money to the better runners.
Enthusiastic spectators cheered all the participants, but were most interested in friends or   family who were participating.
Last year   the marathon grossed four million dollars.
Steve Jones of Wales was the man's   winner, and Grete Waitz of Norway won the women's division for a record ninth time.
The 1988 New York City Marathon drew a field of over 23,000 runners.
President Bill Burke and Vice President   Marie Patrick who have marketing backgrounds drive the race's marketing philosophy.
Over 4,000 runners participated, but the field was considered to be a weak one.
The 1990 Los Angeles Marathon has an impressive list of commercial sponsors.
It was the   largest field in the 19-year history of the marathon.
