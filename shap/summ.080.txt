Samuel Morse Walton, son of a farm mortgage broker, was born in Oklahoma on 29   March 1918.
After a three year stint in the army Walton opened a Ben Franklin franchise, and   eventually became the largest franchisee.
He earned an economics degree from Missouri University and worked for   J.C. Penney's as a management trainee.
He and a brother opened the first Wal-Mart   Discount City in 1962.
In 1987 Forbes estimated the family's stake in the business at about 6.8   billion dollars.
Customers in Wal-Mart here in Fort Walton Beach were surprised to find Sam Walton,   founder of the discount chain, helping cashiers when an electrical glitch shut down the   cash registers.
The brother is still a board member, and Sam's family is involved   in the business.
Walton is famous for his folksy style, and the help to the cashiers came  during a surprise visit to the Florida store.
It does not directly address his company's non-union policies,   and the impact of his 40 billion dollar giant on the mom-and-pop stores in the small   towns where he located his stores.
