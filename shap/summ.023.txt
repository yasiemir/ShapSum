Tanglewood is also celebrating the   50th anniversary of its Music Shed.
The four-day Bernstein gala begins on August 25.
Stars will attend the August 70th birthday bash for conductor Leonard Bernstein at the   Tanglewood Music Center, where he got his start.
He was a member of the Tanglewood class of 1940.
Tickets run from $20 to $5,000 to benefit the music center and Bernstein's fund for   young conductors.
Beverly Sills will be host and the resident Boston Pops Orchestra will play Bernstein's,   classical and popular masterpieces.
He had over 200 classical   recordings, but only six videos are available in the home market--three 1971 Beethoven   programs and three movies with scores he composed.
Leonard Bernstein returned to Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic on   Monday, exactly 45 years after his triumphant conducting debut.
Conductor Leonard Bernstein has cancelled several performances in Japan due to   exhaustion and lingering illness.
Conductors who were mentored by Bernstein will direct the Boston   Symphony, the Boston Pops Orchestra, and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus.
That concert was nationally broadcast and   catapulted Bernstein to fame at age 25.
