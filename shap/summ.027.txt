Virginia Thomas, the white wife of black Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas,   has represented the conservative viewpoint in the various positions she has held.
Women's-rights activists dislike her opposition to comparable-worth legislation, religious   groups are uncomfortable with her anti-cult activities, and some blacks feel the   Thomases' marriage shows his rejection of the black community.
Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee complain that Supreme Court   nominee Clarence Thomas is an evasive witness, but there has been no groundswell of   opposition to his confirmation.
The committee's 14 members seem to   break down into three groups: 5 Republicans solidly for Thomas; 6 Democrats in   opposition; and three swing votes, one Republican and two Democrats.
Clarence's Senate confirmation hearings began yesterday and   are likely to run through next week.
Supporters reply that   the Thomases believe women and minorities are hindered, not helped, by affirmative   action and government programs and their marriage is a reflection of the couple's belief   in a colorblind society.
On Monday Clarence Thomas completed five days of questioning by the Senate   Judiciary Committees and appeared to be well on his way to confirmation.
