The company's loss  adjustors guess that losses to all insurers might exceed $8 billion.
At least three people were killed by the storm in the Bahamas  Sunday and twelve in Florida Monday.
General Accident (GA), the leading British insurer, estimated yesterday that its losses  from Hurricane Andrew might reach $40 million; however, GA has only a half-percent  share of the Florida market and the estimate is based on the assumption that GA's catastrophe insurance would be triggered by the extensive claims.
Other insurers have  estimated that losses from the storm that hit Florida and Louisiana might be anywhere  from $1 billion to $20 billion.
Most of the  insurance claims from damage in Florida and Louisiana will be filed with State Farm,  Allstate, and American International Group insurance companies.
At this time no one is certain of the extent of losses.
Although it is too early to assess the cost of the  storm, one official estimates $15 billion to $20 billion of damage already.
Hurricane Andrew hit southern Florida Monday morning, was moving north-west across  the Gulf of Mexico yesterday, and now threatens New Orleans and the coast from  Mississippi to Texas.
