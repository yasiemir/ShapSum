The Philippine government said it will file criminal charges against former President   Marcos, claiming he stole up to $10 billion of government funds.
Mrs. Aquino, however,   has previously refused to let Marcos return from exile in Hawaii, citing security concerns.
Saturday Manila newspapers quoted Teodoro Benigno, President Corazon Aquinoi's press   secretary, saying Mrs. Aquino told Swiss lawyers that Ferdinand Marcos will be allowed   to return to the Philippines so that he can be tried for stealing billions of dollars.
Swiss lawyers are helping the Philippine government trace money that Marcos allegedly   placed in Swiss banks.
President Corazon Aquino said today her predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos, cannot return   home to die nor will she permit him to be buried here despite an appeal from his wife.
Philippine law prohibits trial in absentia.
Mrs. Marcos' appeal was broadcast by a pro-  Marcos radio station.
During an evening   state banquet, Weizaecker assured Mrs. Aquino that the barrier-free market the European   Economic Community plans for 1992 will not prevent trade with other countries.
President Aquino used small bombers and artillery to end a rebellion led by renegade   army Col. Alexander Noble on Mindanao, countering charges that her government is   indecisive.
