Philippine President Corazon Aquino has agreed to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return so   that he can be prosecuted for stealing billions of dollars.
Manila newspapers reported   today, that she told this to lawyers in Switzerland when she visited there.
Although the Swiss government has frozen these   funds, Swiss law allows secrecy requirements to be lifted only for a criminal prosecution.
He   was ousted in a 1986 coup and is accused of stealing $10 billion, much of it allegedly   deposited in Swiss bank accounts.
She has refused   to allow Marcos, in exile in Hawaii, back into the Philippines, citing security reasons.
His wife, Imelda, and his lawyer are appealing for his return.
Aquino's national security advisor says Marcos' return is still an option, but,   although he is no longer a threat, his followers could cause disruptions.
One group, in sympathy with the coup leader Lt. Col   Gregorio Honasan, held a candlelight vigil outside, then several people entered the   consulate and confronted the acting consul general.
Aquino's reactions to two major coup attempts and six   military mutinies had been indecisive.
Marcos is in critical condition in   Honolulu.
