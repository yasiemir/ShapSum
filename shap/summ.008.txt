Communism's first taste of a Big Mac occurred with the opening of a McDonald's in   Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
The opening of the first of six McDonald's in Yugoslavia in the   next five years drew large crowds.
Many stood in line for up to three hours to get their   first taste of an American hamburger.
Described as a clash between the Big Mac and the Pljeskavica,   the success of McDonald's depends on the acceptance by the Yugoslavs of the Big Mac   over the Pljeskavica.
Priced about the same as the Pljeskavica, the Big Mac will be offered in a   setting that discourages lounging, bans smoking and is alcohol free; a sharp contrast to   traditional Balkan dining custom.
The opening may be the beginning of a competition   between the Big Mac and Yugoslavia's traditional hamburger-like fast food, the   Pljeskavica.
Offering Big Macs, fries and other   McDonald's specialties, some wonder if McDonald's will be as popular as the local fast-  food treat, Pljeskavica.
With a growing middle class, Korea   may be McDonald's most promising foreign market.
In the midst of tough economic times, McDonald's opened its second restaurant in   Moscow as part of a 12 story office block.
