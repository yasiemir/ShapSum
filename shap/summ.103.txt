John Onoda, a spokesman at McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters said the first of   the chain's outlets in a communist country will open on March 24th.
The next scheduled   opening in a communist country will occur by the end of the year in Budapest, Hungary.
Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a   restaurant in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
The success of the   American restaurant will depend on its acceptance by Yugoslavians who are long   accustomed to eating the hamburger like pljeskavica which is made of pork and onions,   served on bread and eaten with the hands, much like a hamburger.
McDonald's negotiations with the Soviet Union over many years have not been fruitful.
This, its first outlet in a communist country, has 350   seats, employs 110 people and is capable of serving 2,500 meals per hour.
In a change to Yugoslav eating customs,   McDonalds will not serve alcohol or allow smoking, nor allow customers to linger long   after their meal is finished.
Police kept an   eye on eager customers who waited in line for hours to get in.
