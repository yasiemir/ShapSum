Fighting between police and Moslem separatists in Srinagar, the summer  capital of the Jammu-Kashmir state killed at least 21 and wounded 100.
Pakistan took the western part of Kashmir and India the  eastern.
Police had imposed a 24-hour curfew to quell the violence resulting from the  militants, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, holding anti-India  demonstrations.
Thousands of Moslems went to a Moslem  saint's shrine to seek blessings to liberate Kashmir from India.
At least 72 people have been killed in the  past week.
The governor of Jammu-Kashmir said that "a  handful of terrorists" are creating a law and order problem, which led to a  government crackdown.
At the end of British colonial rule in 1947, Kashmir opted to  join India.
However, crowds defied the curfew.
Heavy rains caused  fighting to taper off but the situation remains tense and dangerous.
Moslem militants had earlier demanded  union with Pakistan, but more recently are demanding independence for  Kashmir and the status of a neutral nation.
Kashmir militants had earlier campaigned to join Pakistan  because of its predominately Moslem population but now they wish  independence and status as a neutral country.
