As Hugo approached, roads and resort towns from Hilton   Head to Myrtle Beach were nearly empty as coastal residents fled inland and crowded   into shelters.
Hugo, a category 4 hurricane, struck South Carolina Thursday and officials hoped   precautions were sufficient.
119-mph   winds in Charleston brought down power lines, snapped trees, exploded utility   transformers, and littered the street with tin roofs.
Hurricane-force winds first hit land at 9:15pm.
Hugo was expected to turn north, cause severe flooding, and bring tornadoes.
Three hours later the 10-mile   eye of the storm passed just east of Charleston, with top winds of 135 mph.
Before the warning system was established, a Hugo-  sized storm would have killed thousands.
Property damage escalated because Hugo scored a direct hit on   Charleston and then veered northwest.
Last   year's Gilbert, with winds reaching 180mph, is the most powerful hurricane recorded and   seems the upper limit with current ocean temperatures.
Few   residents had experienced such a dangerous, killer hurricane, the first major storm to   strike the city since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles south in 1959.
