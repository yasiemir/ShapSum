The Dog Fanciers Club organized a lunch at Sardi's on Wednesday for two of their   champions, the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog.
Great Elms Prince   Charming II is a fluffy little Pomeranian.
He was named best in show at the prestigious   Westminister Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden last month.
Nero, a big, amiable   bruiser of a German Shepard specializes in sniffing out bombs and narcotics.
Marco, a feisty boxer, walked off with the champion's trophy at Israel's dog-of-the-year   contest held in Tel Aviv's Exhibition Center.
Unfairly,   neither Nero nor Prince got any lunch at this prominent midtown restaurant.
This sanctioned, two-day international   event gave about 20,000 people the opportunity to see about 800 pretty pouches of more   than 50 breeds.
The "intefadeh", the word used to describe the 9-month-old wave of Palestinian   violence in Israel, may have drastically reduced this year's foreign competition as   compared with a similar show last year.
Other attractions include   an expert who will answer behavioral questions about pets, free veterinary advice, a   demonstration of how 4-H youngsters train puppies to become guide dogs and more than   70 vendors selling dog paraphernalia.
