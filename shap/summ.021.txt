Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, are charged with 64 counts   of molestation of children attending their family-owned pre-school and one count of   conspiracy.
Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case said today that they have reached a   verdict on 52 counts of the case and remained deadlocked on the last 13 charges.
This is the longest, most costly, criminal trial in history.
Jurors, in the ninth week of deliberations, have questioned elements   of the charges and appeared confused.
The McMartin Pre-School molestation case began in August 1983 when Judy Johnson   accused Raymond Buckey of molesting her son.
By March 1984, a public outcry had   been created and seven people were arrested for abusing 18 children over 10 years.
One decision could be opening   the sealed verdicts.
Superior Court   Judge William Pounds will hold a hearing on Thursday.
Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case brought widely   divergent reactions.
Special targets of criticism were the personal   ambitions of the prosecutors and the decision to have a private child-therapy group   interview potential victims.
Charges later were dismissed against all but Buckey and his   mother.
