To predict the path, supercomputers   use satellite data to make constantly changing predictions.
The intensity of Hugo was upgraded on the basis of Air   Force reconnaissance just hours before it hit Charleston.
Supercomputers and satellites helped predict the path and landfall of Hurricane   Hugo in time to allow evacuation of Charleston, S.C., but hurricane tracking is   not an exact science.
Forecasters analyze   the predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current   path to make an educated guess about the landfall.
After devastating Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto   Rico on Sunday and Monday with winds up to 150 mph, killing at least 20 people   and leaving perhaps 100,000 homeless, Hurricane Hugo slowed down yesterday to   winds of 105-125 mph, only to pick up speed again and crash into Charleston,   S.C. at midnight with winds of 135 mph.
There are no reliable   computer models for forecasting strength.
Damage from Hurricane Hugo which tore through the Caribbean last week will   reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
By the time Hugo hit Charleston the center's big job was   done.
