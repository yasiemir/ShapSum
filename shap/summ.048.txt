This came as former Conservative members of Parliament   announced that they would vote for the Liberal Democrats.
The Conservatives are moving to replace party leader John Major and remove him as   prime minister.
Major is seen is indecisive   and weak in his handling of foreign and domestic affairs.
In local elections across Britain yesterday, the Conservatives suffered   their worst defeat ever.
Major has also reneged on   campaign promises not to increase taxes.
The defeat put them in third place behind the Liberal Democrats   and the Labor Party.
The honeymoon   following his victory was short lived and his past year has been marked by a number of   controversies.
In a display of solidarity with U.S. policy on the Persian Gulf, Prime Minister John Major   today announced that Iraqi troops have to withdraw completely from Kuwait.
Just a year after winning the general election, a surprise to everyone, Mr. John Major   enters the second year of his term as a deeply unpopular leader.
These controversies include internal party differences over Europe, the   debacle surrounding Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the   European Monetary System, as well as a deep and continuing recession.
