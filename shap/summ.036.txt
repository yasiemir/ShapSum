Only 25-30 percent of area homeowners carry earthquake insurance.
Of the  estimated $500 million in residential damage, between $100 million and $150 million is  insured.
In the wake of Tuesday's earthquake many San Francisco-area homeowners will pay  for damage out-of-pocket while insurance companies may actually benefit from the  quake.
The insurance companies, after three years of declining rates, are likely to win  rate hikes from state regulators to compensate for the combined losses from the  earthquake and Hurricane Hugo which hit the southeastern United States earlier this  month.
Although insurers will pay out billions of dollars for damage from this week's California  earthquake, investors predict that the psychological impact of the catastrophe will  produce higher insurance rates and a long-term gain for insurance companies.
Thus, disappointing earnings in the fourth quarter may be followed by greater  profitability in the long run.
Yesterday, in response to the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew  into a whirlwind of activity that seemed designed to dispel any thought that the White  House was not engaged.
Bush as much  as admitted that the present flurry of activism was intended to counter such criticism,  remarking during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency that he hoped  there would be "less carping" this time about the Agency's performance.
