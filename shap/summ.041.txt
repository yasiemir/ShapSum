More than 18,000 runners are expected to run in the 1987 Los Angeles Marathon.
The city has given the promoters an eight-year operating contract.
Makers of cars, cameras, soft drinks, banks, and   even a hospital have signed on as sponsors in Los Angeles.
Other   marathons have had corporate backing, but Los Angeles is out in front in making a   marathon into a commercial spectacle.
It was the   largest field in the 19-year history of the marathon.
Unlike most   marathons, Los Angeles does not pay appearance money to the better runners.
The 1988 New York City Marathon drew a field of over 23,000 runners.
This year promoters expect to gross five   million, and break even for the first time.
Last year   the marathon grossed four million dollars.
More than 13,000 runners from 13 countries and 49 states ran the Marine Corps   Marathon in Washington, D.C.
Both are relatively   new to running the marathon distance of 26.2 miles, and for each it was the first marathon   victory.
Enthusiastic spectators cheered all the participants, but were most interested in friends or   family who were participating.
