A mass emigration of disaffected East Germans has rekindled reunification talk   in West Germany.
Emerging opposition to uncompromising rule in East Germany has raised questions about   their leaders' ability to resist the democratic reforms sweeping through Eastern bloc   countries.
Close to 80,000 East German refugees have arrived in West Germany   so far this year.
No one is predicting a date for reunification.
There has been   speculation that the Kremlin might stipulate German neutrality as a price for   reunification, meaning a NATO without Germany.
West German Chancellor Kohl said in Moscow that Soviet President Gorbachev had   given him an unequivocal promise to respect German reunification.
He said   that German reunification would not occur in the near future, and when it did, Poland   would insist that a united Germany respect the existing Poland-East German border.
He added that steps must be taken on the economic   front, and East Germans must not leave their country.
Vernon Walters, United States Ambassador   to Bonn, thinks that it could occur in the near future.
He said that a   reunification plan with the agreement of the World War II Allies should be ready before   the year's end for presentation to pan-European summit meeting.
