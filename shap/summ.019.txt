Erich Honecker, the former head of East Germany, died on 29 May 1994 in Santiago   Chile.
Honecker's lawyer, Nicolas Becker said that while he had   refused an operation, Honecker had done everything sensible in regard to treatment.
Egon Krenz, the successor and former   Politburo member Guenter Schabowski gave their versions of the bunker mentality that   engulfed Honecker.
The 81-year-old Honecker and his wife Margot Honecker, had been living with   their daughter in Santiago, since his release from prison in 1993.
It is   not clear whether or not Margot Honecker will be allowed to remain in Chile.
Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was arrested and taken to prison today and a   prosecutor said he will be tried for high treason in March.
It was not   known if Honecker had left a will or where the funeral would be held.

Krenz, who was thrown out 6 weeks after succeeding Honecker, said   he knew nothing about any orders to shoot demonstrators.
