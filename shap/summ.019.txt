A row has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange and the Securities and Exchange   Board of India (SEBI) over its first inspection of the stockbrokers' books.
SEBI accused   the brokers of ignoring rules and authorities of failing to enforce rules and of poor   administration.
The stock market has fallen 48 percent since early last year including   dropping 320 points after the Indian budget was announced.
The exchange denied the charges and called SEBI heavy handed and   inflexible.
The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared to be a   systematic attack on India's commercial heart.
More than a dozen bombs exploded yesterday afternoon in Bombay, killing about 200   and injuring more than a 1,000.
This is just the latest in a series of disputes between SEBI--backed by the   finance minister--and brokers.
Targets included the Bombay Stock   Exchange, Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
All roads into Bombay are blocked and the army is on alert.
India is still recovering from violence that   followed the destruction of a mosque in northern India.
The streets of Bombay are calm, as rubble is being cleared and   stock exchange authorities prepare to resume trading.
