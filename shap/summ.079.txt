Sakharov belongs to the Academy of   Sciences and helped create the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
He vocally supports Gorbachev's   reform campaign but calls for political prisoner liberation and human rights   improvements.
He was exiled to Gorky for   seven years after criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, returning to Moscow with   his wife Yelena Bonner in December 1986.
Andrei D. Sakharov, 66, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize.
Now   press says they live simply.
His apartment is a mecca   for Soviets seeking his aid.
Past Soviet reports called the couple traitors, accusing Bonner of   marrying Sakharov for his money, and saying they lived in luxury amid scandals.
Sakharov supports Gorbachev's reform program but wants   speedier progress in human rights and a nuclear testing ban.
Sakharov's 1975 statement of his views was not published   domestically.
At age 32 Sakharov became the youngest member of   the Academy of Sciences and joined the group that developed the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
Sakharov,   66, and his wife live frugally in their two-room, seventh-floor Moscow apartment, a   mecca for people seeking aid.
