The Xiangijiang River, swollen by rainstorms to a record level of 38.93 m, has flooded   China's Hunan province capital city, Changsha.
Nineteen dykes in the Changsha area have   collapsed.
Yesterday six villages and one fishing   ground at Yulushan township were flooded.
The Changsha city government asked all flood threatened residents to evacuate.
By early   today, roads and bridge surfaces in Changsha's Wangyuehu district and some city streets   were inundated.
Under the leadership of the provincial party committee and   government, the cadres and people had rescued a number of industrial and mining   enterprises.
Over 500,000 soldiers and local residents are helping to fight the floods.
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and   chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Li Peng, premier of the State Council,   have expressed their deep concern for the people in the flooded areas of Guangdong   Province, particularly those in the Zhu Jiang valley.
The Changsha city committee of the Communist Party urges the people to unite as one in   battling the floods.
The reservoirs, however, remained intact and Guangzhou, the capital city, and Zhujiang   River Delta remained safe.
