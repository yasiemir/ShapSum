TGF beta is   normally present in heart cells but is missing from rat heart cells damaged by the   simulated heart attack.
In studies with rats induced to have heart attacks, those rats receiving injections of TGF   beta had 50 percent less cell damage than those not receiving the injections.
According to a study published in the journal Science, cardiac cell damage following a   heart attack may be limited by a natural substance called transforming growth factor beta.
Significantly, however, the chance for a heart attack in patients with heart   pumping problems increased by 25 percent.
The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the   amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue.
Hearts damaged by a heart attack tended to   lose creatine kinase.
A trial involving a group given angiolplasty and a group given TPA did not   show any difference in survival rates after a year.
The chance of another attack decreased 80 percent   in the patients.
Taking a   single aspirin every other day could cut the risk of a heart attack in half.
Nitrates, in use for over 50 years, and beta blockers, which were   developed in the 1960s, are other treatments commonly prescribed by doctors.
