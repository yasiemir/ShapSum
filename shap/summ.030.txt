The ex-senator is expected to make a full recovery.
Preliminary biopsy showed the polyp to be benign.
Former Senator John Tower, the defense secretary-designate had surgery for  removal of a colon polyp.
Tests of the growth showed it to contain some "malignant but well  differentiated cells".
Tower went into business as a defense consultant after he left the Senate in  1985, having served there for 24 years.
He has also served as an arms  negotiator for President Reagan and he headed the White House's Iran-contra  investigative panel.
Chairman Aspin of the  House Armed Services Committee said controversy had already hobbled Tower's  ability to lead the Pentagon.
Paul Weyrich, president of the conservative Free Congress Foundation  testified at the Senate Armed Services Committee that John Tower's behavior  makes him unfit to lead the Pentagon.
Tower has acknowledged that he drank excessively  during the 1970s but now drinks only wine with dinner and if confirmed as  defense secretary would not drink a drop of alcohol.
A Wall Street Journal editorial notes that with John Tower's qualifications  for Defense Secretary "intelligence, patriotism, and past chairmanship of  the Armed Services Committee" he should have sailed through confirmation.
