The Senate Armed Services Committee, controlled by the Democrats, has voted 11-9 along party   lines to recommend that the full senate reject the nomination of former senator John Tower as   Secretary of Defense.
In testimony before the Senate   Armed Services Committee, Paul Weyrich told the committee that Tower may lack the moral   fiber for the position, citing inappropriate use of alcohol and questionable associations with   women.
Rep. Larry Combest, who originally made the allegation,   later said that Tower and a group of friends, not Tower alone, had frequently consumed a bottle   Scotch.
this comes after allegations that on the 1970s, Tower would consume as   much as a bottle of scotch in one sitting.
A Senate Armed Services committee vote to approve former Senator John Tower as Secretary of   Defense was cancelled Thursday following allegations of recent drinking problems as will as   inappropriate behavior with women.
The vote came after a bitter and divisive debate which centered on Tower's   drinking habits, his inappropriate behavior toward women and business dealings with defense   contractors.
Tower, in admitting that he had a drinking problem in the 1970s, promised no to touch a   drop of alcohol if nominated.
