According to a study published in the journal Science, cardiac cell damage following a   heart attack may be limited by a natural substance called transforming growth factor beta.
TGF beta is   normally present in heart cells but is missing from rat heart cells damaged by the   simulated heart attack.
In studies with rats induced to have heart attacks, those rats receiving injections of TGF   beta had 50 percent less cell damage than those not receiving the injections.
The first phase of the study showed that giving tissue plasminogen activator,   or TPA,  a clot-dissolving drug, right after a heart attack dramatically improved chances   of survival.
The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the   amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue.
Tests of Diltiazem, a calcium entry blocker, indicate that its use could prevent recurring   heart attacks in a majority of patients.
The chance of another attack decreased 80 percent   in the patients.
Significantly, however, the chance for a heart attack in patients with heart   pumping problems increased by 25 percent.
This decline can be attributed to changing life styles, which includes fewer   cigarettes, better food and better medical treatment.
