As the U.S. Army band played a song about old Berlin, a crane hoisted the rectangular   white sentry station known as Checkpoint Charlie onto a waiting truck.
For 29 years,   Checkpoint Charlie served as the Allied checkpoint at the only place between the Berlins   that could be crossed on foot by non-Germans.
Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze called for the removal of Berlin's status   as an allied controlled city.
In an elaborate ceremony attended by six foreign ministers, numerous generals, a brass   band and hundreds of reporters, Checkpoint Charlie was lifted on to a flatbed truck and   consigned to history.
Citing Checkpoint Charlie as a symbol of   the Cold War, Secretary of State Baker hoped its removal would "bury the conflicts it   created."
Although the public was not invited to the ceremony, residents of   the street overlooking the checkpoint watched from their windows.
The proposal came   during international talks in East Berlin on the strategic future of a united Germany.
Checkpoint   Charlie became superfluous last Fall when East Germany overthrew its communist   government and the German borders were opened.
