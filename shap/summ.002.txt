The earthquake that struck northern Iran Thursday resembled the Armenian earthquake   of Dec. 7, 1988.
Both killed about 25,000 people most of whom died as their fragile   homes collapsed.
The Iranian quake was the stronger measuring 7.7 (vs. 6.9) on the   Richter scale.
It occurred in an area where most of the adobe buildings are   on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts causing structures to collapse.
The 25,000-strong Iranian community in San Diego has responded quickly to the   earthquake that hit northern Iran on Wednesday, California time.
At least   25,000 died and thousands were injured as residents were buried in the rubble of their   homes.
The Iranian quake occurred just after midnight, so most people were   inside asleep when it hit.
Thursday's quake was the strongest ever recorded in that area where two major plates   of the earth's crust meet.
Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran, claims that the Islamic   Republic of Iran is purposely underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's   massive earthquake (7.3-7.7 on the Richter scale) out of a fear of political backlash.
