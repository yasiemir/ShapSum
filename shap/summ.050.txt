Virginia Thomas, the white wife of black Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas,   has represented the conservative viewpoint in the various positions she has held.
On the other side, senators are receiving the   first of 500,000 anti-Thomas postcards provided by the National Abortion Rights Action   League and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law announced that 86 of   about 110 members of its board of directors oppose Thomas.
Clarence's Senate confirmation hearings began yesterday and   are likely to run through next week.
Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee complain that Supreme Court   nominee Clarence Thomas is an evasive witness, but there has been no groundswell of   opposition to his confirmation.
Supporters reply that   the Thomases believe women and minorities are hindered, not helped, by affirmative   action and government programs and their marriage is a reflection of the couple's belief   in a colorblind society.
On Monday Clarence Thomas completed five days of questioning by the Senate   Judiciary Committees and appeared to be well on his way to confirmation.
Some blacks feel the Thomases' marriage shows his rejection of   the black community.
