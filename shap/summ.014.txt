Family members have denounced the new unauthorized biography of John Lennon   written by Albert Goldman.
In it, he describes the former Beatle as an anorexic bisexual   addled by drugs who raged his way from Liverpool to New York.
Goldman who defends   his book says that it is based on 1200 interviews.
Lennon was murdered outside his   Upper West Side home on December 8, 1980, by Mark Chapman.
The tribute coincides with the release of a new   collection of Lennon's work.
The   Whitney Museum of Art has exhibited her artwork, the American Film Festival is staging   an international tour of her films and a new album is soon to be released.
He talked about his voracious drug use, his perfidy to employees and his   sexual promiscuity.
Fans also gathered in Liverpool   and New York to pay tribute to Lennon.
Goldman who conducted more than 1200 interviews for the book has   written other controversial biographies.
Prior to   meeting Lennon, Newmark was nervous about working with him, but found that Lennon   was just a "working musician".
He says that his sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse and wild   drinking binges fit together with the image Lennon presented of himself.
