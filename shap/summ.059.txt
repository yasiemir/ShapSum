The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accuses the Bombay stock   exchange of flouting regulations including those designed to limit excessive speculative   investments.
The exchange denies the allegations, but the dispute does nothing to   stimulate the stock market where shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early   last year.
This week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which date from   SEBI's creation a year ago.
A militant Sikh group fighting for the   independence of Punjab claims responsibility for the blast, but police and the interior   minister suspect a foreign group or "an international conspiracy."
More than a dozen bombs exploded in Bombay last night killing about 200 people and   injuring more than a thousand in India's commercial heart.
Last night's targets included the Bombay Stock Exchange and the landmark Air India   building.
India's prime minister described the blasts as   an attack on India's economy and said the search for the perpetrators "may not stop   within the country," but stopped short of mentioning Pakistan.
The Bombay Stock   Exchange plans to resume trading today and  the people of Bombay have refused to be   goaded into violent protest by the bombers.
