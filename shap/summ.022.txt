General Accident (GA), the leading British insurer, estimated yesterday that its losses  from Hurricane Andrew might reach $40 million; however, GA has only a half-percent  share of the Florida market and the estimate is based on the assumption that GA's catastrophe insurance would be triggered by the extensive claims.
The company's loss  adjustors guess that losses to all insurers might exceed $8 billion.
Other insurers have  estimated that losses from the storm that hit Florida and Louisiana might be anywhere  from $1 billion to $20 billion.
Although it is too early to assess the cost of the  storm, one official estimates $15 billion to $20 billion of damage already.
Hurricane Andrew hit southern Florida Monday morning, was moving north-west across  the Gulf of Mexico yesterday, and now threatens New Orleans and the coast from  Mississippi to Texas.
Last night U.S. cities along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on  storm watch for Hurricane Andrew which early yesterday caused at least eight deaths  and heavy property damage in southern Florida.
Early reports indicate one death, 75 injuries, and  thousands homeless in Louisiana after 14 deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas.
