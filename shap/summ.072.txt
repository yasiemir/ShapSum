On Saturday at 1 a.m. tens of thousands of troops entered Beijing from the east   marching toward Tiananmen Square.
Blocked east of the square by thousands of   people, the troops dispersed, walking around near the square in small groups.
About   noon two truckloads of People's Armed Police attacked crowds east of the square.
Later about 5,000 troops appeared firing tear gas and clubbing protesters west of the   square.
Skirmishes continued until 9 p.m. when troops started firing at the rock-throwing   protesters.
Shooting continued through the night until 5 a.m. Sunday morning when the   demonstrators,  surrounded by armed and firing troops, began leaving the square,   ending their three-week occupation.
Today's killings and flight of hundreds of thousands of protesters from Tiananmen   Square is the outcome of events beginning with the death of former Communist party   chief Hu Yaobang on April 15 this year.
When declaration of martial law did not intimidate the protesters the   government resorted to the massive use of troops and firepower.
During May the protest movement focused on Tiananmen Square after   about 2,000 students began a hunger strike there and a million citizens rallied to their   support.
