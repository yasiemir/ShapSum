The countdown began Saturday for launching of Space Shuttle Discovery on its mission   of hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) into orbit above the earth's atmosphere.
It may   help test the theory arising from the work of Edwin P. Hubble, for whom it is named,   that the ever expanding universe was created by a tremendous explosion some 15   billion years ago.
Launch is scheduled for 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
The $1.5 billion telescope is expected   to start providing significant scientific data in a month or two.
The   telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday exposing the finely polished   94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
HST is considered to be   the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609.
Charles O'Dell who has worked 19   years on Hubble declared, "There is nothing better than to see 19 years of my work and   five of my friends thrust into orbit."
Five astronauts boarded Discovery today preparing to send the Hubble Space   Telescope (HST) into orbit at an altitude of 380 miles.
Six hours after a failed attempt, ground controllers re-established contact Thursday with   the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) through its main antennas.
