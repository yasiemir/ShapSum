Andrei D. Sakharov, 66, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize.
He was exiled to Gorky for   seven years after criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, returning to Moscow with   his wife Yelena Bonner in December 1986.
He vocally supports Gorbachev's   reform campaign but calls for political prisoner liberation and human rights   improvements.
Now   press says they live simply.
Andrei D. Sakharov, brilliant physicist and prominent 1970s dissident, won the 1975   Nobel Peace Prize.
Sakharov belongs to the Academy of   Sciences and helped create the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
Past Soviet reports called the couple traitors, accusing Bonner of   marrying Sakharov for his money, and saying they lived in luxury amid scandals.
After criticizing Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, without trial he   was exiled to the closed city of Gorky from January 1980 to December 1986.
Gorbachev   allowed him to return to Moscow in December 1986.
Sakharov,   66, and his wife live frugally in their two-room, seventh-floor Moscow apartment, a   mecca for people seeking aid.
Sakharov always does the dishes.
Sakharov supports Gorbachev's reform program but wants   speedier progress in human rights and a nuclear testing ban.
