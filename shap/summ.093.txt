Supercomputers and satellites helped predict the path and landfall of Hurricane   Hugo in time to allow evacuation of Charleston, S.C., but hurricane tracking is   not an exact science.
The best information for   predicting hurricanes still comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane.
To predict the path, supercomputers   use satellite data to make constantly changing predictions.
A real killer, it was the first major hurricane to strike   Charleston since Gracie made landfall 70 miles to the south in 1959.
The intensity of Hugo was upgraded on the basis of Air   Force reconnaissance just hours before it hit Charleston.
Forecasters analyze   the predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current   path to make an educated guess about the landfall.
Although the hurricane claimed 17 lives in South Carolina,   Charleston, which took the brunt of the storm, lost only two.
There are no reliable   computer models for forecasting strength.
After devastating Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto   Rico on Sunday and Monday with winds up to 150 mph, killing at least 20 people   and leaving perhaps 100,000 homeless, Hurricane Hugo slowed down yesterday to   winds of 105-125 mph, only to pick up speed again and crash into Charleston,   S.C. at midnight with winds of 135 mph.
