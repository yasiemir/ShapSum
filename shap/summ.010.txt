A US Geological Survey geophysicist compared  the quake to Armenian quake two years earlier.
The earthquake, which devastated Iran killed at least 25,000 people and  injured thousands more.
The quake  registered a magnitude 7.7 which is considered a major quake and is the  largest ever recorded in Iran, although twelve quakes greater than magnitude  7 have occurred there in the past 30 years.
Most of the homes were built on  a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and  allows buildings to collapse.
This quake was the  strongest ever recorded in Iran, which is in a very active seismic region  and has recorded 12 quakes of magnitude 7 in the past 30 years.
The Iran quake was of magnitude 7.7 while the Armenian was 6.9  but both killed about 25,000 persons and for essentially the same reasons:  most victims were in houses that were shoddily built or otherwise fragile  and could collapse easily.
By plundering  Iran's oil and other resources, it said, the US prevented use of even a  small part of national resources for development of anti-seismic  construction methods.
Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran charged that the  Iranian government is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties  from the massive earthquake that struck northern Iran.
