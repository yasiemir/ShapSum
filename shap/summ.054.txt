The Kuwaiti Embassy announced on Wednesday that Iraqi troops had launched an   offensive against Kuwait.
The U.S. had circulated drafts of a   resolution calling for an embargo on Iraq's oil exports, an embargo on imports to Iraq,   and a halt to all arms and military supplies to Iraq.
Earlier, Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its Kuwaiti   border after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the OPEC cartel   had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's revenue, and that Kuwait had been   stealing oil from a field that straddles the border.
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis   occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the oil   facilities.
Foreigners in Kuwait, including many Americans, are keeping a low   profile.
Iraq claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this small, oil-rich kingdom.
Kuwait's new Iraqi-installed government claimed that Iraqi troops began pulling out of   Kuwait on Sunday.
On Tuesday, John Kelly, a State   Department spokesman, told a House subcommittee that the United States has no treaty   obligations mandating military support for Kuwait; however, we do believe strongly in   respect for territories of all states in the region.
