Kuwait's U.S. ambassador   appealed for U.S. military intervention.
Iraq's powerful army quickly claimed victory today in its invasion of Kuwait.
All of Kuwait is occupied.
Iraq's army invaded tiny oil-rich Kuwait today and with a force of 100,000 quickly   overcame the smaller country's 20,300-strong armed forces.
Iraq's invasion followed its accusation that   Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area and exceeded OPEC production quotas.
The Kuwaiti   Emir fled to Saudi Arabia.
(The Iraqi-installed Kuwait government had   earlier told foreign countries not to forget their citizens in Kuwait while punishing Iraq.)
If the Security Council   approves  these sanctions it would be the first time since 1967 that it has taken such   action against a member state.
Tension eased somewhat when Iraq and Kuwait   agreed to meet for discussions, but when they met on July 31 Iraq massed 100,000   troops on the border facing Kuwait's 20,000-strong armed forces.
The new Iraqi-installed government of Kuwait claimed that Iraqi troops began a pullout   from Kuwait Sunday, but the United States doesn't believe it.
The Iraqi government claimed it invaded at   the request of revolutionaries who had staged a coup and established "the provisional   government of free Kuwait."
