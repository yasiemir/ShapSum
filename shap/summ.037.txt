Greek divers located the remains of a wooden sailing vessel on 3 May 1988.
The vessel   was found near Chios, a Greek island in the eastern Aegean Sea, where a Greek naval   vessel sank a Turkish warship on 7 June 1882.
More than 1,000, including 400 Greeks, were aboard the Turkish ship.
It was returning from raiding and killing thousands of Greeks on Chios.
The Greek divers hope to interest American and Turkish  experts to help in recovering the vessel.
The Turkish vessel was identified as the Bourloti Seimaz, or translated as "Explosives   Invincible".
A freighter with a cargo of beer sank today 28 nautical miles north of the Ameland, a   Dutch island in the North Sea.
Another Austrian   politician, who like Gratz, was involved in the scandal, resigned last month.
This is an area of heavy freight traffic.
The ship sank   about 12:45 P.M. in high winds.
A United States Coast Guard ship on patrol spotted a man and woman in a raft about 30   miles off the coast of Costa Rica.
The ship was   crammed with loot taken from Chios.
It was insured for 16 million   dollars.
