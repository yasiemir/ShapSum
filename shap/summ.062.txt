One said, "Once you have a palace coup, the possibilities are endless."
One   intriguing scenario has Gorbachev hatching a false coup in order to step out of the way while   hard-liners and liberals battle each other.
This week's events in the Soviet Union have Kremlinologists who dabble in conspiracy theories   working overtime.
The coup, one of the most tumultuous developments in recent Soviet history,   unraveled in a series of swift and dramatic developments.
The Communist Party,   seeking to salvage its image, denounced the takeover.
The coup falls apart and Gorbachev returns to power   stronger than before.
A specialist in Soviet affairs has written an article asking the question: "Did Mikhail Gorbachev   orchestrate the coup that almost overthrew him?"
Kremlin watchers said theorizing was fueled by the fact that tanks did not   roll until hours after Gorbachev's arrest, President Yeltsin was not arrested, Leningrad was left   alone and, reportedly, many of the tanks had no ammunition.
Predictably, the hard-liners would fail because opposition to the coup was against "the illegality   of the principle" of usurping power, and fear that if Gorbachev could be "rolled up" other   democratically elected officials could be too.
