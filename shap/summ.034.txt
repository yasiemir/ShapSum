Indiana Republican Senator Dan Quayle, 41, was chosen by George Bush to be his    presidential running mate.
Quayle, from Huntington, Indiana, graduated from a small   liberal arts college, DePauw University, in 1970 and went to work in the Indiana   Attorney General's office.
They married in 1972 while still in school.
Republicans compare vice-presidential nominee-designate Dan Quayle to Thomas   Jefferson because he has "the same fire in his belly" and to John F. Kennedy because   they would be relatively the same age when running for office.
He met his wife Marilyn, 39, when they were law students at   Indiana University in Indianapolis.
His sister   Martha Saddler lives in Huntington.
Quayle is said to be the same nice guy he was in law school.
Bob Dole nominated Dan Quayle, the junior senator from Indiana, for vice president at   the Republican National Convention in August.
They have   three children, 14-year-old son Tucker, 12-year-old son Benjamin, and 9-year-old   daughter Corinne.
Dole called him one of the bright young   lights in the Republican Party, a dedicated public servant, a forceful advocate, a staunch   supporter of the Reagan revolution, and a devoted family man.
