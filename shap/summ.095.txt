An operation to lower the cholesterol levels of heart attack patients reduced their risk of   another heart attack or death from heart disease.
A study at the Jefferson Medical   College in Philadelphia showed that laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks,   suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of TGF beta than rats that did not   receive TGF beta.
The TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as   tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack.
In the operation, called ileal bypass, one   third of the small intestine is bypassed.
Diliazen, a calcium entry blocker, is one of a new class of drugs   in the fight against heart disease.
Doctor's also found that one aspirin and a single dose of clot   dissolving given within 24 hours of heart attack dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal   heart attack.
Study results suggest the drug may be   effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients.
Any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with TGF beta is at least a   year away.
