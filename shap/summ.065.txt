Over several hours on Thursday Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure fell from 132 over 60   to 112 over 50 and his pulse dropped from 104 per minute to 84, according to Imperial   Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
Hirohito, 87, has been bedridden for a month.
He has received nearly 22 pints of blood   since his illness worsened Sept. 19.
Maeda said the emperor's blood pressure   has returned to its normal level, but that the intestinal hemorrhaging that began a month   ago resumed Thursday and the pace of the discharges was quickening.
A palace source said he gets 600-700 calories a day,   intravenously.
Hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has not discharged blood in nine   days.
I t was the first time that tax authorities have   disclosed the amount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official said.
Emperor Hirohito's condition weakened Friday, but doctors speculated that a scab had   stopped internal bleeding, said Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
Taiwan will be represented at the funeral, but a Taiwanese newspaper said, "While   Hirohito apologized to the United States and Europe, he did not direct a single word to   China to show his sorrow."
