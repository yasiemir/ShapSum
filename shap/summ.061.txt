The latest issue of the Soviet News included a sensitive article on Andrei Sakharov and   his wife, Yelena Bonner.
In the past the state-run media has branded the dissident couple   as traitors.
The article made only indirect mention of Sakharov's forced exile in the   closed city of Gorky.
He and Yelena live frugally in Moscow.
He was exiled for criticizing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Sakharov is a member of the prestigious Academy of Sciences and a 1975 Nobel Peace   Prize winner.
Sakharov now supports Gorbachev, but wants all political prisoners released.
Sakharov is the father of the Soviet dissident movement.
Now, in May 1988, the Moscow   News has published an article that makes a clear attempt to refute some of the charges   made by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media against Sakharov and his wife.
Andrei Sakharov was banished without trial to the closed city of Gorky in January 1980.
He was allowed to return to Moscow in December 1986.
Andrei Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the   Congress of People's Deputies.
