The early season drought is the worst since record keeping began in 1895.
A   large portion of the U.S. was suffering from drought stress and about 35 percent of the   contiguous United States was rated severe to extreme by July 2.
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, speaking at a meeting of farm magazine, extension,   advertising, co-op, and broadcasting editors, said that although the United States is   suffering from a severe drought, the U.S. will continue to be a major player in world   agriculture.
If the drought continues,   the area affected could exceed the 60 percent of 1934 and the 50 percent of 1954.
Good harvests are expected in other parts of the   world but in the Sahel region of sub-Saharan Africa, damage from locust could cause   crops losses of 1 million tons.
The current drought is not yet as bad as those suffered in the   1930s and the 1950s but does equal one in 1911.
The drought and high temperatures continue to plague sections of the United States.
Farmers could expect little relief from the drought in the near term according to weather   forecasters.
