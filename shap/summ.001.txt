In only 5 years, it has become the best marketed, slickest, most modern   and sponsor-driven of the world's major marathons.
The lineup of commercial support is   impressive.
Mercedes-Benz, along with other sponsors, provides the race with the bulk   of its operating budget.
The Los Angeles marathon has a marketing orientation rather than that of a first class   athletic event.
The tours are geared to those who want to run   in a marathon and last year one tour operator took 5,500 people to tours to 20 countries   from Bermuda to Moscow.
Organizers of the marathon expect to   increase this year's total purse of $202,520 by $100,000 next year.
The marketing approach makes the race lucrative, but it does not   give it prestige or attract the world's best runners.
The event lacks some of the superstars who race in   Boston, New York and London.
The Los Angeles marathon is a commercial spectacle.
In   addition its cool summer temperatures make it one of the few places where you can have   a marathon in the middle of the summer.
The Boston Marathon is becoming a reckless speed duel and the last three have produced   five of the top 10 times in the race's history.
