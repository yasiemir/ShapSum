The announcement of Gorbachev's illness and a  palace coup provides a starting point for speculation.
Kremlinologists who look for conspiracies are working overtime on recent  events in the Soviet Union.
Could it be that  Gorbachev has co-opted the coup?
Tanks did not roll until hours after  Gorbachev's supposed arrest and it was said that many of the tanks that  surrounded the Parliament building had no ammunition.
The proposed treaty  reduces Moscow's centralized control and strengthens powers of the 15 Soviet  Republics.
Russian President  Boris Yeltsin was not arrested.
Even Eduard Shevardnadze, a longtime ally of Gorbachev,  considered the possibility that he was behind the activities.
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev prepared to return to Moscow from the  Crimea and reclaim power after the coup against him collapsed and its  leaders fled.
According to the theory,  Gorbachev did not  want any bloodshed.
Speaking before the Russian Parliament, Gorbachev affirmed Yeltsin's decrees  issued during the coup as legitimate.
Some say that he was a member of the  conspiracy in order to thwart the signing of the new Union Treaty or to  ferret out disloyal elements.
The reactionary elements staging the coup in the Soviet Union miscalculated  by thinking the issue was Mikhail Gorbachev.
