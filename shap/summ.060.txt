It may   help test the theory arising from the work of Edwin P. Hubble, for whom it is named,   that the ever expanding universe was created by a tremendous explosion some 15   billion years ago.
The countdown began Saturday for launching of Space Shuttle Discovery on its mission   of hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) into orbit above the earth's atmosphere.
Controllers sent   positional information to the telescope and widened the radio beam to cover a larger   area around the two high-speed  antennas.
The long delayed launching of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has evoked a burst   of superlatives from the nation's scientists.
After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was   freed from the shuttle Discovery at 3:38 p.m. EDT on Wednesday and placed in orbit   380 miles above the earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has previously flown.
Edward   Weiler, the chief NASA scientist on the HST project declares, "On a clear, dark night   you can see a flashlight from two miles away.
The $1.5 billion telescope is expected   to start providing significant scientific data in a month or two.
