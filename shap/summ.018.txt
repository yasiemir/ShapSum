He has received nearly 22 pints of blood   since his illness worsened Sept. 19.
Hirohito, 87, has been bedridden for a month.
Over several hours on Thursday Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure fell from 132 over 60   to 112 over 50 and his pulse dropped from 104 per minute to 84, according to Imperial   Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
Maeda said the emperor's blood pressure   has returned to its normal level, but that the intestinal hemorrhaging that began a month   ago resumed Thursday and the pace of the discharges was quickening.
A palace source said he gets 600-700 calories a day,   intravenously.
Emperor Hirohito's condition weakened Friday, but doctors speculated that a scab had   stopped internal bleeding, said Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
Hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has not discharged blood in nine   days.
News reports quoted Maeda as saying Hirohito, 87, normally weighs104 pounds, but now   weighs only 66 pounds.
South Korea sent condolences, but a government party statement added, "We reserve   further comment, considering the unhappy past."
Emperor Hirohito, 87, will be remembered for his first effective and the most courageous   decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must surrender and end the Pacific conflict in   WW II.
