The latest issue of the Soviet News included a sensitive article on Andrei Sakharov and   his wife, Yelena Bonner.
In the past the state-run media has branded the dissident couple   as traitors.
Sakharov now supports Gorbachev, but wants all political prisoners released.
He was exiled for criticizing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
The article made only indirect mention of Sakharov's forced exile in the   closed city of Gorky.
Andrei Sakharov was banished without trial to the closed city of Gorky in January 1980.
He and Yelena live frugally in Moscow.
He was allowed to return to Moscow in December 1986.
Tass reported that the organization held a meeting, but did not mention Sakharov.
Andrei Sakharov's visit to the United States has gone virtually unreported in Moscow,   with only a radio broadcast saying he had voiced opposition to the "Star Wars" program.
Sakharov is a member of the prestigious Academy of Sciences and a 1975 Nobel Peace   Prize winner.
President   Gorbachev praised him as a "man of conviction and sincerity".
Andrei Sakharov finally accepted a 1973 human rights award Thursday during his first   trip to New York City.
