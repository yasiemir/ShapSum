Hugo, a category 4 hurricane, struck South Carolina Thursday and officials hoped   precautions were sufficient.
Hurricane-force winds first hit land at 9:15pm.
As Hugo approached, roads and resort towns from Hilton   Head to Myrtle Beach were nearly empty as coastal residents fled inland and crowded   into shelters.
Three hours later the 10-mile   eye of the storm passed just east of Charleston, with top winds of 135 mph.
Payments in North Carolina and Virginia will bring the total   to $500 million, more than three times its 1983 record payout of $165 million for   Hurricane Alicia.
119-mph   winds in Charleston brought down power lines, snapped trees, exploded utility   transformers, and littered the street with tin roofs.
Hugo was expected to turn north, cause severe flooding, and bring tornadoes.
Hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science, but forecasters' predictions of Hugo's   destructive path gave people time to flee South Carolina's coast.
Hurricane Hugo raged into Charleston Thursday night packing 135-mph winds.
St. Paul Cos. said the pretax cost of Hugo   shouldn't exceed $50 million.
With unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions, world temperatures could   rise 10 degrees and the greenhouse effect could breed hurricanes 50% stronger than   Hugo, which blasted the Caribbean and Carolinas last week with 135mph winds.
