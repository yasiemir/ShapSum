On Tuesday, a second attempt will be made to launch the shuttle Discovery with the $1.5   billion Hubble Space Telescope aboard.
Meanwhile, shuttle Columbia is also being prepped to launch a   satellite called Astro.
This is only the second time both shuttle pads at Kennedy Space   Center have been occupied simultaneously.
Countdown resumed Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed launch on Tuesday to   boost the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
A faulty power unit forced cancellation of the   first attempt on April 10.
The replacement power unit was successfully test fired   and the telescope's battery charging was completed one day ahead of schedule.
Columbia's Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation.
The new Tuesday launch day is   14 days after the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty   hydraulic power steering unit.
It took three attempts to deploy the telescope's second   solar array panel, thus causing the delayed release from Discovery to operational orbit.
Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for   initial operations and that caused many malfunctions.
It will scan the outermost reaches of space for clues   about the origin and possible end of the universe.
