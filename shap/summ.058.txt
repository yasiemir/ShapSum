A flash flood Thursday night sent a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high through communities   along the Ohio River, killing at least 10 people and leaving 40 to 60 missing, authorities   said.
The Shadyside Fire Department established a command center at the Jefferson   Elementary School to coordinate rescue efforts.
The flood occurred after thunderstorms Thursday night dumped about 4 inches of   rain in about an hour.
Thunderstorms swept through central and eastern Ohio Thursday night causing flooding   that killed at least 10 people in Belmont County and caused the evacuation of about 200   residents from their homes in Licking and Jefferson counties.
Two creeks outside of Shadyside, Ohio overflowed, knocking homes off their   foundations and washing away a Shadyside bar filled with people.
On Sunday searchers in the rural area of eastern Ohio found a body in debris along   Wegee Creek and extracted two from the Ohio River, bringing the death toll from flash   floods that swept through the area last Thursday to19.
Authorities said a "wall of water" was created.
Few people in the area carried flood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not   cover the flood damage.
