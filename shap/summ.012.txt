Greek divers have found the remains of a Turkish warship, the Bourloti  Seimaz, in the eastern Aegean near the island of Chios.
Greek  revolutionaries had sunk the ship in 1822 in revenge for Turkish killing and  looting on Chios.
The remains of the ship lie under 162 feet of water  making recovery difficult.
Thousands died in Chios and this action put European  countries behind the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman  Empire, which they won in 1830.
A Finnish-registered freighter with a cargo of beer sank in high winds in  the North Sea.
The Greeks had rammed the Turkish ship with  a boatload of explosives.
A West German helicopter rescued the crew members from their life  rafts.
The sinking occurred off the Dutch coast near the island of  Ameland.
The Ostwind, a yacht built for Adolf Hitler, was sunk to commemorate the  "Voyage of the Damned" in which a ship carrying over 900 Jews escaping the  Holocaust was turned away and forced to return to Europe and to Nazi  concentration camps.
The Greeks escaped the explosion that killed the  Ottoman commander.
The Dutch Navy also responded to the scene, sending a plane and  two lifeboats.
