Other Wal-Mart executives follow his example.
People say Sam is as old-fashioned and homespun as his principles, which declare the   customer is always right.
Walton's personality permeates operations and his whole family is in the business.
He was   born in Oklahoma, the son of a mortgage banker.
He is happy to chat with customers, but shuns the press   especially when asked about his massive fortune.
He opened Wal-Mart Discount City in   1962.
Walton turns 71 in March.
Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton helped the check-out clerks in his Fort Walton Beach,   Florida store on Tuesday evening.
He had come   to the Fort Walton Beach store to attend a promotional concert in its parking lot.
He was visiting when a computer problem shut down   the cash registers, so he took a note pad and started writing down prices for customers so   their bills could be added more quickly.
Many recognized him and he shook hands and   chatted.
Sam Walton is arguably the most important retailer of his generation.
