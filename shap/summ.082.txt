The earthquake that struck northern Iran on Thursday killing about 25,000 people   registered 7.7 on the Richter scale.
Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a   ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily and the quake occurred just after   midnight, so most people were inside asleep when it hit.
For hours the only detailed reporting by the Islamic Republic News   Agency (IRNA) was that Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup   soccer match when the quake hit.
Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran, claims that the Islamic   Republic of Iran is purposely underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's   massive earthquake (7.3-7.7 on the Richter scale) out of a fear of  political backlash.
It occurred in an area of Iran   where most of the buildings are on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts and   allows structures to collapse.
Countries sending assistance to victims of   Thursday's quake include the Soviet Union, Mexico, the Vatican, West Germany,   Turkey, Spain, India, Austria and France.
The quake of 7.7 magnitude was the largest ever   recorded in that area where two major plates of the earth's crust meet.
