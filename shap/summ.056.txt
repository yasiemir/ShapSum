She has refused   to allow Marcos, in exile in Hawaii, back into the Philippines, citing security reasons.
Philippine President Corazon Aquino has agreed to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return so   that he can be prosecuted for stealing billions of dollars.
Manila newspapers reported   today, that she told this to lawyers in Switzerland when she visited there.
He   was ousted in a 1986 coup and is accused of stealing $10 billion, much of it allegedly   deposited in Swiss bank accounts.
Although the Swiss government has frozen these   funds, Swiss law allows secrecy requirements to be lifted only for a criminal prosecution.
President Corazon Aquino said today she will not allow ousted leader Ferdinand Marcos   to return home to die or allow his body to be buried in the Philippines.
Aquino's national security advisor says Marcos' return is still an option, but,   although he is no longer a threat, his followers could cause disruptions.
Imelda's   spokesman has said she is trying to reach Aquino, but this is denied by Aquino's   daughter.
Friday, President Corazon Aquino refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the   Philippines to die or permit his body to be buried here.
