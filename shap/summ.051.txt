Earlier, Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its Kuwaiti   border after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the OPEC cartel   had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's revenue, and that Kuwait had been   stealing oil from a field that straddles the border.
Iraq claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this small, oil-rich kingdom.
Kuwait's army was no match for Iraq's.
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis   occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the oil   facilities.
The Kuwaiti Embassy announced on Wednesday that Iraqi troops had launched an   offensive against Kuwait.
On Tuesday, John Kelly, a State   Department spokesman, told a House subcommittee that the United States has no treaty   obligations mandating military support for Kuwait; however, we do believe strongly in   respect for territories of all states in the region.
Within hours after invading Kuwait, Iraqi forces had captured the capital and were   continuing on toward the oil facilities.
But White House Press Secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said that we   have no independent confirmation of that, and furthermore, Saddam Hussein's past   actions have created serious skepticism about his intentions.
