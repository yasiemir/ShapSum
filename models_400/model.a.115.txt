John Major, who   was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her   successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the   Conservative Party and will become prime minister .
Major, 47, her   chancellor of the Exchequer, is the youngest person to be   elected Britain's prime minister since the 19th Century   .
Major, 47, fell   two votes short of winning a majority in voting among the   372 Coservative Party members of Parliament, but his two   opponents quickly conceded defeat and the party confirmed   Major as the winner.
The past 12 months   have been hijacked by internal party differences over   Europe, by the debacle surrounding UK withdrawal from the   exchange rates mechanism of the European Monetary System,   and by a continuing, deep recession which has disappointed   and alienated many traditional Tory supporters in   business.
For a long time,   John Major has failed to resolve the economic crisis and has   seriously jeopardized the interests of British people, who   have become poorer with each passing day and suffer from a   high rate of unemployment.
There is a general   perception that, important though Britain's future place in   Europe is, the prime minister has been excessively   preoccupied with community affairs and associated internal   party ructions, to the detriment of the domestic   economy.
